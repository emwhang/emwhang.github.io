My name is Esther Whang, I am a 3rd year Ph.D. Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University developing ultra-fast neuroimaging systems. I am co-advised my Dr. [Ji Yi](https://www.yilab.org/) and Dr. [Adam Charles](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/ascharles/). I work intersection of optics, signal processing, and neuroscience, focusing on how the concepts of computational imaging (joint design of hardware and software) can enable the capture of faster neural dynamics. 

Before my Ph.D., I studied at the Cooper Union, where I obtained a Bachelors and Masters in Electrical Engineering. While at Cooper, I worked on e-textile devices for motion capture with Dr. Mili Shah and Dr. Jennifer Weiser. As a part of the Berkeley SUPERB REU program, I worked as a summer Undergraduate researcher at Berkeley with Dr. [Laura Waller](https://www.laurawaller.com/) on physics-informed deep learning for image deblurring. After my graduatoin, I also interned at Formlabs in developing a lwo-cost optical system for manufacturing quality assessment. 

Beyond my research, I am passionate about supporting students interested in STEM and in graduate education and have been involved in various programs for such causes. For fun, I also volunteer at the [Baltimore Rock Opera Society](https://www.baltimorerockopera.org/), using my EE background to make cool props and effects for their theater productions.
