Education
======
* Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 2028 (expected)
* M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, 2023
* B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, 2023

Work and Research Rxperience
======

**Johns Hopkins School of Medicine** | Baltimore, MD  
*Ph.D Candidate; Advisors: Prof. Adam S. Charles, Prof. Ji Yi* | August 2023 - Present

* Developing a two-photon microscopy system for neuroimaging that speeds up acquisition up to 20 times compared to standard systems ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15487))
* Created a matrix completion-based reconstruction algorithm in MATLAB that reconstructs high-resolution videos using as little as 5% of original measurements
* Validated algorithm through a simulation pipeline using a [MATLAB-based simulator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027021001084), demonstrating that reconstructed traces maintain high correlation with ground truth even under realistic motion and noise

**Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Summer Course** | Cold Spring Harbor, NY  
*Optics and Data Science Teaching Assistant* | July 2024 - August 2024; July 2025 - August 2025

* Guided a cohort of 16 PhD students, postdocs, and early-career scientists through the construction of a two-photon microscope
* Instructed students on data analysis techniques for imaging data as well as utilizing high-performance computing resources

**Formlabs** | Somerville, MA  
*Optical Engineering Intern* | June 2023 - August 2023
* Designed and deployed a manufacturing quality assessment pipeline for a critical transparent printing component in the [Form4](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-4/) printer
* Built a low-cost, bench-top laser-cut optical setup to capture information about geometric characteristics from transparent material, reducing testing costs compared to commercial alternatives

**University of California, Berkeley (WallerLab)** | Berkeley, CA  
*Computational Imaging Undergraduate Researcher; Advisor: Prof. Laura Waller* | June 2022 - August 2022
* Developed a physics-informed deep learning approach for deblurring images with spatially-varying blur
* Utilized PyTorch to build a deep learning model that deblurs images with radially-symmetric aberrations (published in [Nature Methods](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-025-02684-5))
